.Studied about the some of the html tags and used to created the pages with the "hyperlink"

.HTML links are hyperlinks.

.You can click on a link and jump to another document.

.When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand
.The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>

ex:
<html>
<body>

<h1>HTML Links</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a></p>

</body>
</html>

.By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

.An unvisited link is underlined and blue
.A visited link is underlined and purple
.An active link is underlined and red
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

.The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:

. Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
.blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
.parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
.top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

ex:
<html>
<body>

<h2>The target Attribute</h2>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a> 

<p>If target="_blank", the link will open in a new browser window or tab.</p>

</body>
</html>

.Inserted some images in the header and footer with the help of <img> tags
.Definition and Usage
.The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

.Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

.The <img> tag has two required attributes:

.src - Specifies the path to the image
.alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
.Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.

.Tip: To link an image to another document, simply nest the <img> tag inside an <a> tag (see example below).
ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" width="42" height="42" style="border:5px solid black">

</body>
</html>
