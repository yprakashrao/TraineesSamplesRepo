                    What's ManishHub ?
                </div>
                <p>
                    ManishHub is a software solution that allows administrators to manage
                    users within an organization. This system typically includes features such as user authentication,
                    access control, and user provisioning. With a user management system, administrators can easily
                    create,
                    modify, and delete user accounts, as well as assign specific permissions to each user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This helps to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data or resources, while
                    also simplifying the process of managing large numbers of users. Additionally, some user management
                    systems also include features such as password management and multi-factor authentication to further
                    enhance security.
