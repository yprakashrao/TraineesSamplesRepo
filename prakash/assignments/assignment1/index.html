        <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
            implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
            programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
            that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
            that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
            syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
            runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically
            not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming
            languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a
            reported 9 million developers.[21]

            Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core
            component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers,
            virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May
            2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its
            Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine,
            however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used
            by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

            As of March 2022, Java 18 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support
            (LTS) versions.
