     <p class="p3">Alluri Sitarama Raju (4 July 1897 or 1898 – 7 May 1924)[1] was an Indian revolutionary who waged an armed campaign against the British colonial rule in India. Born in present-day Andhra Pradesh, he became involved in opposing the British in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act, which effectively restricted the free movement of Adivasis in their forest habitats, and prevented them from practicing their traditional form of agriculture known as podu. Rising discontent towards the British led to the Rampa Rebellion of 1922, in which he played a major role as a leader. Mustering forces combined of Adivasis, farmers and other sympathizers to their cause, he engaged in guerilla campaigns against the British colonial authorities in the border regions of then Madras Presidency, now parts of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam. He was nicknamed "Manyam Veerudu" (transl. Hero of the Jungle) by local villagers for his heroic exploits.[2]

        Harnessing widespread discontent towards the British colonial rule in the backdrop of the non-cooperation movement, Alluri led his forces against the British, aiming to expel them from the Eastern Ghats region through his guerilla campaigns. During this period, he led numerous raids on local police stations to acquire firearms for his under-equipped forces. After each raid, he would leave behind a letter written by him, informing the police about the details of his raids, including about the weaponry he parted away with, daring them to stop him if they can. Police stations in and around the areas of Annavaram, Addateegala, Chintapalle, Dammanapalli, Krishna Devi Peta, Rampachodavaram, Rajavommangi, and Narsipatnam were all targeted by his forces in the raids which also saw significant police casualties. In response to these raids, and in order to quell the rebellion, the British colonial authorities undertook a nearly two-year long manhunt for him, resulting in expenditures reaching over ₹40 Lakh rupees then. Eventually, in 1924, he was trapped by the British at the village of Koyyuru in the Chintapalle forests. There, he was captured, tied to a tree and summarily executed by a firing squad. His resting place currently lies in the village of Krishnadevipeta.</p>
